## Projects  

### Medical Diagnosis Chatbot using Multi-modal LLM  
**Project Overview:**  
Developed an AI-powered medical image analysis chatbot that leverages multi-modal LLMs to analyze medical images and generate detailed reports, including an option to simplify complex medical diagnoses into easy-to-understand language.  

**Technical Details:**  
- Utilized **Google GEMINI** and **GROQ** LLMs for generating detailed medical analysis reports.  
- Incorporated **Streamlit** for building an interactive and user-friendly web interface.  
- Integrated multi-modal capabilities to process and analyze medical images, such as X-rays and CT scans, alongside natural language prompts.  
- Implemented an **ELI5** (Explain Like Iâ€™m 5) feature to simplify medical explanations for non-medical users.  
- Used **Google GEMINI**'s advanced language model for generating comprehensive medical diagnosis and **GROQ**'s conversational AI for simplifying technical content.
- Streamlined workflow with **temporary file handling** for image uploads, processing, and result display.

### LLM Chatbots Development  
**Project Overview:**  
Developed and deployed conversational AI chatbots using LLMs with Hugging Face Transformers, Groq, and OLLAMA for local deployment.  

**Technical Details:**  
- Fine-tuned pre-trained models for specific use cases.  
- Implemented advanced tokenization techniques and managed context length to ensure optimal user interactions.  

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)  
**Project Overview:**  
Integrated multi-modal RAG to enhance chatbot functionality by combining LLMs with external knowledge sources.  

**Technical Details:**  
- Utilized vector embeddings for efficient document retrieval.  
- Leveraged Chroma-DB for similarity search and applied a hybrid approach to refine context for LLMs using LangChain and LangGraph.  

### Quantitative Forecasting Models  
**Project Overview:**  
Developed predictive models using Transformer architecture, NBEATS, and TFT for time series forecasting. Automated the model training process with PyCaret and visualized results through Power BI dashboards.  

**Technical Details:**
